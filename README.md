# VirtualMicrobe
Incomplete real-time metabolic modelling tool

A conceptual metabolic modelling tool in real-time. Made for understanding the concepts behind metabolic modelling tools. Reads and writes text and CSV files, visualisation with Matplotlib and an artificial intelligence to decide the most efficient series of reactions to produce the metabolites needed for an objective reaction.
The virtual microbe began as a side project coding a simplistic metabolome of bacteria. A fully functioning metabolic modelling tool was not the intention; it was a learning project and believed had learnt everything from it before moving onto new project.
